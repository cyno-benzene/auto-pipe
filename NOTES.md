## 2. Application Architecture

### Microservices vs Monolith

```mermaid
graph TB
    subgraph "Monolithic Architecture"
        A[Single Application]
        A --> B[User Interface]
        A --> C[Business Logic]
        A --> D[Data Access Layer]
        A --> E[Database]
    end
    
    subgraph "Microservices Architecture"
        F[API Gateway]
        F --> G[User Service]
        F --> H[Order Service]
        F --> I[Payment Service]
        G --> J[User DB]
        H --> K[Order DB]
        I --> L[Payment DB]
    end
```

#### Our Project Architecture:
- **Single Service**: FastAPI application (microservice approach)
- **Stateless**: No server-side session storage
- **API-First**: RESTful API design
- **Health Checks**: Built-in monitoring endpoints

### REST API Design Principles

#### HTTP Methods:
- **GET**: Retrieve data (idempotent, safe)
- **POST**: Create new resources
- **PUT**: Update entire resource (idempotent)
- **PATCH**: Partial update
- **DELETE**: Remove resource (idempotent)

#### Status Codes:
- **2xx**: Success (200 OK, 201 Created, 204 No Content)
- **4xx**: Client errors (400 Bad Request, 401 Unauthorized, 404 Not Found)
- **5xx**: Server errors (500 Internal Server Error, 502 Bad Gateway)

### FastAPI Deep Dive

**FastAPI** is a modern Python web framework for building APIs with automatic documentation and type safety.

#### Key Features:
1. **Type Hints**: Automatic validation and documentation
2. **Async Support**: High performance with async/await
3. **Automatic Docs**: OpenAPI/Swagger integration
4. **Dependency Injection**: Clean, testable code architecture

#### Code Example Analysis:
```python
# Type safety with Pydantic
class Item(BaseModel):
    id: int
    name: str
    description: str = "A sample item"

# Async endpoint for better performance
@app.get("/items/{item_id}", response_model=Item)
async def read_item(item_id: int):
    # Automatic validation of item_id as integer
    return Item(id=item_id, name=f"item-{item_id}")
```

## 3. Containerization Deep Dive

### What are Containers?

**Containers** package applications with all their dependencies into a lightweight, portable unit.

```mermaid
graph TB
    subgraph "Traditional Deployment"
        A[Physical Server]
        A --> B[Host OS]
        B --> C[App 1 + Dependencies]
        B --> D[App 2 + Dependencies]
        B --> E[App 3 + Dependencies]
    end
    
    subgraph "Container Deployment"
        F[Physical Server]
        F --> G[Host OS]
        G --> H[Container Runtime]
        H --> I[Container 1]
        H --> J[Container 2]
        H --> K[Container 3]
        I --> L[App + Dependencies]
        J --> M[App + Dependencies]
        K --> N[App + Dependencies]
    end
```

### Docker Architecture

```mermaid
graph TB
    A[Docker Client] --> B[Docker Daemon]
    B --> C[Images]
    B --> D[Containers]
    B --> E[Networks]
    B --> F[Volumes]
    C --> G[Registry/ECR]
```

#### Key Docker Concepts:

1. **Image**: Read-only template for creating containers
2. **Container**: Running instance of an image
3. **Dockerfile**: Instructions to build an image
4. **Registry**: Storage for images (Docker Hub, ECR)
5. **Volume**: Persistent data storage
6. **Network**: Container communication

### Multi-Stage Docker Builds

Our Dockerfile uses multi-stage builds for optimization:

```dockerfile
# Stage 1: Base image with dependencies
FROM python:3.11-slim as base
WORKDIR /app
COPY requirements.txt .
RUN pip install -r requirements.txt

# Stage 2: Application layer
COPY ./app ./app
# Final optimized image
```

#### Benefits:
- **Smaller Images**: Only production dependencies
- **Security**: Reduced attack surface
- **Caching**: Better layer caching
- **Separation**: Build vs runtime environments

### Docker Compose Concepts

**Docker Compose** defines multi-container applications using YAML.

#### Our compose.yml Analysis:
```yaml
services:
  web:
    build: .                    # Build from Dockerfile
    ports:
      - "8000:80"              # Port mapping
    environment:               # Environment variables
      - ENV=development
    volumes:                   # Mount source code
      - ./app:/app/app:ro
    healthcheck:               # Container health monitoring
      test: ["CMD", "curl", "-f", "http://localhost:80/health"]
```

    G --> A
```

#### Benefits:
- **Consistency**: Identical environments
- **Version Control**: Track infrastructure changes
- **Automation**: Reduce manual errors
- **Documentation**: Code as documentation
- **Disaster Recovery**: Rapid rebuilds

### Our IaC Approach

#### 1. Shell Scripts:
```bash
# setup.sh - Infrastructure provisioning
aws ecr create-repository --repository-name auto-pipe-api
aws ecs create-cluster --cluster-name auto-pipe-cluster
aws logs create-log-group --log-group-name /ecs/auto-pipe-app
```

#### 2. JSON Templates:
```json
// taskdef.template.json - ECS task definition
{
  "family": "auto-pipe-task",
  "requiresCompatibilities": ["FARGATE"],
  "containerDefinitions": [...]
}
```

#### 3. GitHub Actions:

## 9. Interview Questions & Answers

### DevOps Fundamentals

**Q: Explain the difference between CI and CD.**

**A**: CI (Continuous Integration) automatically integrates code changes from multiple developers by running automated builds and tests. CD (Continuous Deployment) extends CI by automatically deploying successful builds to production. CD ensures that code is always in a deployable state and reduces manual deployment errors.

**Q: What are the benefits of containerization?**

**A**: Containerization provides:
- **Consistency**: Same environment from dev to production
- **Portability**: Run anywhere containers are supported
- **Isolation**: Applications don't interfere with each other
- **Efficiency**: Lower overhead than virtual machines
- **Scalability**: Easy horizontal scaling

### AWS Services

**Q: Explain the difference between ECS and EKS.**

**A**: 
- **ECS**: AWS-native container orchestration, simpler to use, proprietary API
- **EKS**: Managed Kubernetes service, more complex, open-source API, better for teams already using Kubernetes

**Q: What is AWS Fargate and when would you use it?**

**A**: Fargate is serverless compute for containers. Use it when:
- You don't want to manage EC2 instances
- You have variable workloads
- You want to focus on applications, not infrastructure
- You need better security isolation

### Security

**Q: Explain OIDC and why it's better than storing AWS keys in GitHub.**

**A**: OIDC (OpenID Connect) allows GitHub Actions to assume AWS roles without storing long-lived credentials. Benefits:
- **No static secrets**: Credentials are temporary
- **Automatic rotation**: New tokens for each workflow
- **Fine-grained access**: Specific permissions per repository
- **Audit trail**: Clear access logging

**Q: What is the principle of least privilege?**

**A**: Give users/services only the minimum permissions needed to perform their tasks. This reduces security risks by limiting potential damage from compromised accounts or applications.

### Monitoring

**Q: What's the difference between monitoring and observability?**

**A**: 
- **Monitoring**: Watching predefined metrics and known failure modes
- **Observability**: Ability to understand system behavior from external outputs, including unknown failure modes

**Q: What are SLIs, SLOs, and SLAs?**

**A**: 
- **SLI** (Service Level Indicator): Specific metrics (e.g., response time)
- **SLO** (Service Level Objective): Target values for SLIs (e.g., 99.9% uptime)
- **SLA** (Service Level Agreement): Contract with consequences for missing SLOs

### Troubleshooting

**Q: How would you troubleshoot a failing ECS service?**

**A**: 
1. Check service events in ECS console
2. Review CloudWatch logs for application errors
3. Verify task definition configuration
4. Check IAM permissions for execution/task roles
5. Validate security group and network settings
6. Review resource limits (CPU/memory)

**Q: Your CI/CD pipeline is failing. What's your debugging approach?**

**A**: 
1. Check the failing step in GitHub Actions logs
2. Reproduce the issue locally if possible
3. Verify environment variables and secrets
4. Check service dependencies and network connectivity
5. Review recent changes that might have caused the issue
6. Validate infrastructure state in AWS console

### Best Practices

**Q: How do you ensure zero-downtime deployments?**

**A**: 
- **Rolling deployments**: Gradually replace old containers
- **Health checks**: Ensure new containers are healthy before routing traffic
- **Load balancer integration**: Automatic traffic routing
- **Rollback strategy**: Quick revert to previous version
- **Database migrations**: Backward-compatible changes

**Q: What's your approach to secrets management?**

**A**: 
- **Never commit secrets to code**
- **Use dedicated secret stores** (AWS Secrets Manager, GitHub Secrets)
- **Inject secrets at runtime** through environment variables
- **Rotate secrets regularly**
- **Audit secret access**
- **Use service accounts** instead of user credentials
